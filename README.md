Hi,
This is my first application, which I develop and document with the assistance of GitHub. 
Hardly Waiting :)

------

This application would assist drives in Budapest to find a parking place and pay from their mobile.
  
Solutions / Requirements:
  - Easy to find out how much is one hour in your current zome
  - Find free parking zones
  - Easy to pay with your mobile (with using the vendor's current working environment)
  - Reminds you if you too far from your car
  - Reminds you if your parking is still ongoing 
  - Uses mobile net / GPS (GIS)
  
To be continnued if development is in TEST phase...
